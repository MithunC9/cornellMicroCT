# Cornell MicroCT Image Processing Starter

This project is an early-stage learning and development environment for microCT image processing workflows.

Goals:
- Learn how to load and process CT-style image data
- Practice segmentation and visualization
- Prepare tools for analyzing in-situ compression experiments once the scanner arrives

Current features:
- Load images
- Perform basic segmentation
- Save processed outputs
